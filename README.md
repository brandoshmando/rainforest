Rainforest
==========
Rainforest was an assignment I was required to do while at Bitmaker Labs. It is a replica Amazon app (minus the eCommerce part...). The app itself has no styling but was a great practice for backend and database relation design. It consists incorporates concepts like a user model that allows a user to create an account and log in, preventing actions if a user is not signed in, nested routes, and database relationships amongst many others.
